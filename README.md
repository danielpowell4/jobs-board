**Employee-Owned and B Corps Job Board**

Moovjobs is an job board concept for employee owned companies. This was developed in 2015/16 in partnership with the Rocky Mountain Employee Ownership Center.

In short, Moov displays jobs from the Indeed API for a list of known Employee-owned or B Corps companies.

This project, which seems to be in permanent BETA, is a neat, ever evolving data set of jobs meant to help job seekers unlock "ladders to what's next."
